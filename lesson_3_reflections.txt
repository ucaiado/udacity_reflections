When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share my work or keep my git somewhere where I can use in multiples machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In this way I can work freely in my ideas without mess up my working codes stored in my remote repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a kind of clone made in your github account. It stays linked to the original repository, although I am still not sure how it works. Clone is a local copy of a repository, where you can change everything without change the original files. Branche is something that you create at the same repository with the same purpose of clone. I guess you use fork when you want to collaborate or just analyse the someone else work; Clone probably is the same and when you want to do things in your local machine.... and the Branch you use to organize new changes or experiments.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can change the files freely and without introduce potential bugs in the working codes.
